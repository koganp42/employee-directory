# EmployeeDirectory
An app that functions as a directory for a companies employees

## Installation

Clone folder onto your own computer by forking the repository and using the "Clone or download" button on github.

Install all npm modules using the command "npm install".

Run the server by calling "npm start" from the root folder. 

## Functionality
The app would allow for a company to track a list of its current employees and view them by a diverse set of criteria. Currently, it allows the user to sort or filter the pre-generated list of employees by their age.

## Coding

Created with react.js and utilizes randomuser API to get fake employee data to populate the directory.  

## Future Improvements
I would expand the filtering and sorting functions to allow the user to do either on each data point. I would also touch up the UX side to make the app more appealing.
